# yourSafari
Adds a tab bar item to safari to play youtube videos through firecore's youtube plugin on the AppleTV

This safari extension will allow you to send videos straight to your jailbroken AppleTV 2 into the firecore youtube plugin.

There are a few requirements for this to work properly

1. A jailbroken AppleTV 2 with firecores youtube plugin installed
2. Your AppleTV has the standard Apple-TV.local name / domain address
3. AirControl is installed on your AppleTV 2

Usage:

If you are on a youtube video page, press the new "Open video on AppleTV" button, if all the requirements are met, the video will start playing automatically on your AppleTV!

Installation:

Make it possible to customize the address of the AppleTV.
